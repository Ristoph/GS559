## 3d. (10 points) Write a program that takes two files each containing a matrix of integers, multiplies them using a
## function, and then prints the result. Remember that matrix multiplication is only valid for a matrix of size NxM (N
## rows, M columns) and one of size MxP (M rows, P columns), for any N, M, and P, and results in a matrix of size
## NxP.
