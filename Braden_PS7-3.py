# Write a function CalcDistance(point1, point2) that calculates the Euclidean distance between
# point1 and point2. Each point is given as a list of numbers that represent its coordinates in an ndimensional
# space. You can use the function math.pow(x,y) that returns x raised to the power y
# and the function math.sqrt(x) that returns the square root of x
